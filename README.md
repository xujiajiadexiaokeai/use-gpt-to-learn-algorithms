Use GPT to Learn Algorithms
---

# Introduction
Trying to use GPT-3 to learn algorithms. And understand the principles behind the algorithms and how they work.

The algorithms will be implemented and tested using Golang.

All records of communication with gpt will be stored in this repository.â€‹

This is a work in progress.

# Progress
- [X] Red Black Tree
